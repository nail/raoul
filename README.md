# Raoul

A javascript IRC bot running on *node.js*, using a *CouchDB* backend.
You are free to provide your own store backend. This is a pretty wrong use for CouchDB but I wanted to get my hands on it.

## Synopsys

Raoul will:

* Record everything one says in its store
* Randomly use those quotes to answer when you address him (or intelligently if your store implements it... Up to you!)
* Use *watchers* to handle specific actions
